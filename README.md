Repository Title: University Admission Regression Analysis

Description: This repository contains a predictive analysis project focused on estimating the probability of admission to prestigious universities for Indian students. Leveraging regression techniques, particularly Linear Regression along with Ridge and Lasso regressions, this project explores various factors influencing graduate admissions.

Project Overview: 
Objective: Predicting admission probabilities for Indian students to IVY league colleges based on diverse factors.
Language Used: Python
Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, statsmodels, scikit-learn
Concepts Applied: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Data Preprocessing, Model Building, Assumption Testing, Model Performance Evaluation, Insights & Recommendations.

Concept Used:

1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Defined problem statement and conducted thorough EDA to understand dataset characteristics.
Analyzed data structure, types, and performed categorical attribute conversion where necessary.
Conducted univariate analysis (distribution plots for continuous variables, barplots/countplots for categorical variables).
Explored bivariate relationships to understand variables' impact on graduate admissions.

2. Data Preprocessing:
Checked for duplicate values, treated missing values, and handled outliers.
Engineered features and prepared data for modeling.

3. Model Building:
Built Linear Regression model and commented on statistical metrics.
Displayed model coefficients with column names.
Experimented with Ridge and Lasso regression techniques.

4. Testing the Assumptions of Linear Regression:
Checked for multicollinearity using VIF score.
Ensured mean of residuals was close to zero.
Verified linearity of variables through residual plot examination.
Tested for homoscedasticity and normality of residuals.

5. Model Performance Evaluation:
Evaluated model using metrics such as MAE, RMSE, R², and Adj R².
Assessed train and test performances and provided insights for model improvement.

6. Actionable Insights & Recommendations:
Highlighted significance of predictor variables in graduate admissions.
Suggested additional data sources for model enhancement and real-world implementation, emphasizing potential business benefits.
